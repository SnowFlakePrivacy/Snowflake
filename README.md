# SnowFlake Project
  So what is the SnowFlake project? The SnowFlake project is a social media network hosted over a onion enabled distributed network. What this means is you are in control of who gets to see what you post and who get to know that you are even posting it.

  Q:
  Why should you trust me with your data.
  A:
  You should not. I am the boogie man. I could be a CIA agent, a Russian spy trying to hack anyone, a trained professional, or Zuck himself. What you can trust is the code itself. You can look at all of it, read it line by line compile it yourself compare that with the releases and report any evil things I might be up to.

  You will not get to know who I am. Because their are groups in the world that want to undermine your privacy if I was to reveal who I am to anyone I risk my own safety.

  Remember the way this platform protects your identity in by hiding you in a crowd. This means the more people that use it the safer it is. It is much easier to hide in a crowed without a mask then by yourself with one.

## Report Vulnerability
  If their is the tiniest flaw in security report it as soon as you can. You can do this by opening a issue on the repo or by emailing me at snowpidge@protonmail.com

## Want to get involved?
  If You would like to get involved you and pull the repo and start working on it. Try and contact me at snowpidge@protonmail.com before you start just so I can direct the work flow so we don't waist our time by doing work twice.

## Other Privacy Centric Projects:
  * Tor - A project that is designed to hide your internet traffic.
  * Tails OS - A open source operating system that is designed to not leave a trace.
  * Monero - A type of crypto currency designed to hide your wallet and transactions.
  * Duck Duck Go - A search engine that doesn't track you.
  * Proton Mail - A emailing service that encrypts all messages sent to and from you so that only you and your target can read them.

## Donate:
Why because I am doing this on my free time. I don't profit off of this in any way other then donations. If a large enough donation stream comes in then I will be able to dedicate more of my time to this project. As it is now I go to bed at 1:30PM every night working on this then get up at 7:00AM to go to work. That leaves from 7:00PM to 1:30PM to work on this or 6.5 hours a day. I would like to be able to work on this 18.5 hours a day. Anything helps.
